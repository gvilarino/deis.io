Deis is one of the most active projects on GitHub, with almost 4,000 stars and 600 forks. As activity
on the project has increased, so has the workload of the core maintainers, who are tasked with responding
to all new issues, fixing bugs, developing features, and helping the community.

In an effort to ensure that Deis continues to grow efficiently, we've asked two of our
most active community members to join us as maintainers. We are thrilled to welcome [Johannes Würbach](https://github.com/johanneswuerbach)
and [Manuel de Brito Fontes](https://github.com/aledbf) to the project as contributing maintainers!

Manuel and Johannes have both contributed a substantial amount of code to the project, have regularly
helped users in IRC and GitHub, and have a great attitude. The project has benefited significantly
from their contributions.

For more information on the Deis maintainers and their responsibilities, see the maintainer
[documentation](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md) in the project.

We're also always hiring folks to work on Deis full-time, so please reach out if you're interested!
